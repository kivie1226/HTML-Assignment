        <h1>Best Memories at Walgreens</h1>
        <p1>During my years at Walgreens, I've had a lot of great memories that I'll look back on and smile about.
            Some of them weren't the best situations to be put in, but I chose to make the best of it and laught it off.
            Here are some of my favorite memories:</p1>

        <h3>The Time I had to Buy Pants:</h3>

        <article class = "Pants">
        <p2>On one overnight shift, I was pulling the cleaner bay. I was getting so much done!
            Just when I was getting my last few boxes of laundry detergent down, I started to feel something
            cold and wet all over the front of me. The box of detergent I was holding was upside down, which
            caused it to leak out all over me. Since I was the only manager on duty and I didn't want to work in
            wet pants all night, I bought the only pair of pants sold. They were ugly gaucho pants that
            made me look like I was wearing a skirt. They were horrendous, but my cashier and I couldn't stop
            laughing about it all night.

        <h3>The Time I got to Look Like a Doctor:</h3>
        <img class="Doctor" src="C:\Users\kivie\Pictures\Saved Pictures\Looking Like a Doctor.jpg" >
        <article class= "Doctor"
        <p3>This story isn't very glamorous either. One time, I went to go to the bathroom and found a nice
            surprise. There was an older lady who had just gotten done in the bethroom before me. When I went
            in, there was a lot of poop in places that it shouldn't have been. I will spare you all of the details,
            just know that it was gross and not at all how I wanted to spend my shift. I was also the only person willing
            to clean it up. Corporate had just sent down some kits to clean up bodily fluids, so I opened up the
            kit and used it exactly how it said. <br>This thing was absolutely ridiculous! It had me in a mask with protective eyewear and everything.
            It was way over the top for cleaning up bodily fluids. I thought it was hilarious and showed everyone
            in the store. That day, I may have had to clean up poop, but I got to look like a doctor while doing it.

        <h3>The Time I Spent With My Grandpa:</h3>
        <img class="Grandpa" src="C:\Users\kivie\Pictures\Saved Pictures\Grandpa.jpg" >
        <article class= "Grandpa"
        <p4>My grandpa used to live by the store I worked at and would occasionally come by to spend a little time with
            me. I never had much time to visit, but always made it a point to be with him as much as possible.
            He seemed to always come in at the worst times, but it would always brighten my day to see him and 
            talk for a little while. It would make all of my stress and worries disappear temporarily. My 
            favorite picture that I have with him is during one of theses moments.
